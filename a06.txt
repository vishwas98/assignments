ASSIGNMENT-06
A bigger solid cube is to be built using n number of smaller cubes, having unit length. Write a program that:
a)Read n from user with suitable message
b)Check  if  n  is  valid,  that  is  can  a  bigger  solid  cube  be  build  using  n  number  unit length cubes
c)Calculate the surface area of bigger cube, s1
d)One unit length cubic block is now removed from every corner of the cube. Calculate the surface area of new structure, s2
e)Prints with suitable message, both surface areas s1  and s2
f)Print what conclusion can be drawn with respect to  s1  and  s2
 
LOGIC BEHIND THE PROBLEM DEFINITION:
To form a bigger cube from the unit length cubic block , the number of unit length cubic block should be a perfect square.
After removing unit length cubic block from every corner of the bigger cube.
The surface area of the body will remain unchanged, it exposes three faces, which makes the number of exposed faces same as before removal.



PROGRAM : 

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>
int main()
{
    int i,number;
    float s1,s2;
    //part a
    printf("Enter the number of smaller cubes: ");
    scanf("%d",&number);
    //part b
    for(i=0;i<=number;i++)
    {
        if(number==i*i)
        {
            printf("\n %d is a valid number",number);
        }

    }
    //part c
    s1=6*number;
    printf("\nSurface Area is %f",s1);

    //part d
    if(number==4)
        s2=0; // as all blocks removed

    else
    s2=(6*number)-(8*3)+(8*3);//which is same as 6n

    if(number!=4)
    {
        s1=s2;//
    }
    else{
        s1=6*4;
        s2=0;
    }
    //return 0;
    printf("\ns1\ts2");
    printf("\n%f\t%f",s1,s2);
}

OUTPUT : 
CASE 1: 
Enter the number of smaller cubes: 4

 4 is a valid number
Surface Area is 24.000000
s1      s2
24.000000       0.000000
