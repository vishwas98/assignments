ASSIGNMENT-03

Consider three dimension system. A point in three dimension system is represented as ( x , y , z )
where x , y and z are the x , y and z coordinates of the point in three dimension space respectively. Write a program that:
a)Reads from end user using suitable messages :
    i.Point p1(x1,y1,z1),and
    ii.Point p2( x2,y2,z2)
b)Prints with suitable message all partial derivatives between the points(p1,p2)

LOGIC : 
Takes input from the user p1&p2 then difference p2-p1 is partial difference.

PROGRAM :
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include<math.h>

int main()
{
    int x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2,x,y,z;
    printf("Enter the Co-ordinates of the point p1:\n");//Takes the co-ordinates values of point p1
    scanf("%d %d %d",&x1,&y1,&z1);

    printf("Enter the Co-ordinates of the point p2:\n");//Takes the co-ordinates values of point p2
    scanf("%d %d %d",&x2,&y2,&z2);

    x=x2-x1;
    y=y2-y1;
    z=z2-z1;

    printf("The function f(a)= %dx+(%dy)+(%dz)",x,y,z);
    return 0;
}


OUTPUT:
CASE 1:
Enter the Co-ordinates of the point p1:
7 8 9
Enter the Co-ordinates of the point p2:
4 5 2
The function f(a)= -3x+(-3y)+(-7z)
Process returned 0 (0x0)   execution time : 16.606 s
