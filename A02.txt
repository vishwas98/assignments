ASSIGNMENT-02
A straight line in two dimension can be represented with y=mx +c,where y and x are the y and x coordinates
of the point on line in two dimension space respectively. m is slope of the line and c is intercept made by the
line with y axis. Write a program that:
a)Reads from end user using suitable messages :
    i.Slope m
    ii.Intercept c
    iii.Values of x
b)Reads from end user using suitable messages: a random point (xp ,yp)
c)Print with suitable message if (xp,yp) is on the line y=mx +c

LOGIC:
In order for the given point to lie on the line, it must satisfy the equation of the line.
Check whether y = (m * x) + c holds true.


PROGRAM:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include<stdbool.h>

int main()
{
    int m=0,c=0,x=0,y=0;
    //Read the values of m,c,x,y from end user
    printf("Enter the values of slope m, constant c, x-coordinate, y-coordinate:");
    scanf("%d %d %d %d",&m,&c,&x,&y);
    if(point_On_Line(m,c,x,y))
    {
        printf("\nThe Point (%d,%d) lies on the line y=mx+c",x,y);
    }
    else
    {
        printf("\nThe Point (%d,%d) doesn't lies on the line y=mx+c",x,y);
    }
    return 0;
}
int point_On_Line(int m,int c,int x,int y)
{
    // check Whether the values satisfies the standard equation of the line y=mx+c.
    if(y==(m*x)+c)
        return 1; //Return 1 if satisfies.
    else
        return 0;//Return 0 if it doesn't satisfies.
}


OUTPUT:
CASE 1:
Enter the values of slope m, constant c, x-coordinate, y-coordinate:4 6 1 10

The Point (1,10) lies on the line y=mx+c
Process returned 0 (0x0)   execution time : 19.682 s
