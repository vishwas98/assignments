Assignment 4
Write a program that:
a)Reads from end user using suitable messages a integer k , where k represents count of digits in a integer
b)Find the probability p1, that the k-digit number does NOT contain the digits 0 , 5 , 9
c)Print with suitable message the probability p1
d)Now consider digit set as only d = { 0 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 9 }
e)Find the probability p2, that the a k-digit number does NOT contain the digits 0 , 5 , 9
f)Print with suitable message the probability p2
g)Print what conclusion can be drawn with respect to  p1  and  p2

LOGIC BEHIND THE PROBLEM DEFINITION:
Total possibilities =(10)raise to k, because every digit has 10 options from 0 to 9.
Possibility of not containing any digit 0,5,9=(7)raise to k, now every digit has 7 options.
probability = (7)raise to k/(10)raise to k=(0.7)


PROGRAM:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include<math.h>

int main()
{
    int k;
    float p,q,r,s;
    float p1,p2;
    printf("Enter the value of k which represents the count of digits:\n");
    scanf("%d",&k);
    p=pow(10,k);// 10 because every digit has 10 options from 0 to 9.
    printf("Total number of possibilities are :%.2f\n",p);

    printf("Possibility of not containing any digit 0,5,9 is\n");
    q=pow(7,k);// 7 because now every digit has 7 options excluding 0,5,9.
    printf("%.2f\n",q);
    printf("The p1, that the k-digit number does NOT contain the digits 0 , 5 , 9 is : ");
    p1=q/p;
    printf("%.2f\n",p1);

    printf("\nNow considering digit set as only d = { 0 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 9 }\n");
    r=pow(7,k);//7 because total possibilites needs to be choosen between available digit set(which are 7 in number).
    printf("Total number of possibilities considering digit set as only d = { 0 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 9 } is : %.2f\n",r);

    printf("Possibility of not containing any digit 0,5,9 is\n");
    s=pow(4,k);// 4 because now every digit has 4 options excluding 0,5,9(1,3,4,7 the remaining 4).
    printf("%.2f\n",s);
    printf("The probability p2, that the a k-digit number does NOT contain the digits 0 , 5 , 9 is :");
    p2=s/r;
    printf("%.2f\n",p2);

    return 0;
}
 

OUTPUT:

CASE 1:
	Enter the value of k which represents the count of digits:
4
Total number of possibilities are :10000.00
Possibility of not containing any digit 0,5,9 is
2401.00
The p1, that the k-digit number does NOT contain the digits 0 , 5 , 9 is : 0.24

Now considering digit set as only d = { 0 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 9 }
Total number of possibilities considering digit set as only d = { 0 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 9 } is : 2401.00
Possibility of not containing any digit 0,5,9 is
256.00
The probability p2, that the a k-digit number does NOT contain the digits 0 , 5 , 9 is :0.11
