ASSIGNMENT-05
 The area of a square is d. What is the area of the circle which has the diagonal of the square as its diameter? Write a program that:
a)Reads from user: area of a square as d (an integer).
b)Check if area entered, d is valid.
c)Find the area of the circle whose diameter is the same as the diagonal of the square.
d)Find the circumference of the circle whose radius is the same as the diagonal of the square.
e)Prints with suitable message the area and circumference of the circles respectively.

LOGIC:
1].To find the diagonal of the square
    diagonal=sqrt[side*side + side*side]
2].To find the area of the circle
    area=3.142or(pi)*(radius*radius)
2].To find the Circumference of the circle
    circumference=2*pi(3.142)*radius

PROGRAM:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include<math.h>
#define PI 3.14159265358979323846

float findArea(float diagonal)//This function returns the area of the circle
{

    float radius,area;
    radius=diagonal/2.0;//given the diagonal is same as that of the radius of the circle
    area=PI*(radius*radius);
    return area;
}

int main()
{
    int d,side;
    float diagonal,area,circumference;
    printf("Enter the area of the square:\n");
    scanf("%d",&d);
    side=sqrt(d);;// to find each length of a square
    diagonal=sqrt(side*side+side*side);
    area=findArea(diagonal);
    circumference=2*PI*diagonal;
    printf("The Area of the circle is : %.2f\n",area);
    printf("The Circumference of the circle is : %.2f",circumference);
    return 0;
}


OUTPUT:
CASE 1:
Enter the area of the square:
64
The Area of the circle is : 100.53
The Circumference of the circle is : 71.09
Process returned 0 (0x0)   execution time : 5.886 s
